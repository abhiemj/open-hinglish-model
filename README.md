### Papers

### Datasets
Collection of the Datasets on ðŸ¤— Hub: [Hindi/Hinglish Instruct/Chat Datasets](https://huggingface.co/collections/smangrul/hindi-hinglish-instruct-chat-datasets-658eca76f1aef46ec0f40df4)

### Models/APIs/Chabots
Collection of the models on ðŸ¤— Hub: [Hindi/Hinglish Models](https://huggingface.co/collections/smangrul/hindi-hinglish-models-658ecbeb3533188375f980ea)
1. [sarvamai/OpenHathi-7B-Hi-v0.1-Base](https://huggingface.co/sarvamai/OpenHathi-7B-Hi-v0.1-Base): First model in the OpenHathi series of models that will be released by Sarvam AI. This is a 7B parameter, based on Llama2, trained on Hindi, English, and Hinglish. More details about the model, its training procedure, and evaluations can be found [here](https://www.sarvam.ai/blog/announcing-openhathi-series).
2. [Hi-NOLIN-9B](https://huggingface.co/nolanoAI/Hi-NOLIN-9B): A checkpoint at the 600B tokens on the new training dataset that contains Hindi. We also observe the Bilingual model to generalize to Code-Mixed English-Hindi informal language of Hinglish - a popular mixed language currently spoken by over 350 million people.
3. [Krutrim](https://olakrutrim.com/), [OpenAI](chat.openai.com), [Gemini Pro on Bard](https://bard.google.com/chat)
